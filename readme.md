# This is my Book Review Angular Web Application

This is a simple application used to learn the basics of the MEAN stack.
I have created an express application that connects to a Mongo database through the API.
I also created a simple registration angular component.

The angular component is located in a seperate repository and was built and implemented into 
this MEAN stack project.

The project was finally placed on a heroku website. If the link is still active it should be here:
